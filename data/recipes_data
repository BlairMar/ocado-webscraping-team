Created by Chris Leach, the founder of Manteca restaurant in London, and Guardian Feast writer and chef, it elevates the classic combination of pork and apple with a generous splash (or two) of white wine. We use trebbiano, which has a bright crispness that matches well with the acidity of the apples. Slow cooking leaves you with a wonderfully tender joint and a rich sauce. Full of thyme, onion and garlicky goodness, we recommend serving with mashed potatoes or a hunk of crusty bread (or both). \n\nPhotograph: Rita Platts/The Guardian. Food styling: Sam Dixon.

Pipe stripes down the side of the pastry, running along the pastry strips, and leave for 5 mins. These are best eaten soon after baking, with vanilla ice cream on the side."

Brining meat is a great way to tenderise it and add flavour, plus using great-value cuts like chicken legs make it a very affordable family dinner.

            "Description": "One of the many joys of going to France is the breakfast pastries. Here pastry chef, author and TV presenter Ravneet Gill shows us how to prepare brioche buns with custard and a peach and basil topping. The key for the brioche is to prepare the pastry the night before \u2013 it will improve the flavour and make it firmer and easier to shape (not to mention it means you won\u2019t have to rise with the birds). The next morning, most of your efforts will be spent making the cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re or cr\u00e8me p\u00e2t, which is a thick pastry custard found in fruit tarts, souffl\u00e9s and mille-feuille. When you break it down like that, this is a simple enough recipe, but what a result. A somewhat indulgent breakfast, but the fruit will leave you feeling virtuous.",

Prepare the marinade up to 24 hours beforehand and leave the chicken to absorb the spices in the buttermilk. You could also prepare the relish before serving \u2013 this will allow the charred pepper and chillies to cool down before you start handling them. All that prior preparation will leave you with a really tasty kebab, and more time to enjoy it.  ",

            "Description": "In a nod to tradition, we\u2019ve chosen comforting roast beef and green veg for this recipe, but fresh herbs, beans and chilli keep flavours light and upbeat. The beef has a lovely herby marinade with a warming dash of chilli and it's cooked with red peppers, which absorb the juices from the meat. Rather than boiling or steaming like usual, here the veggies are fried in butter and much richer for it. Bernaise is classic French sauce, but don\u2019t be put off. You can quickly knock it up using a blender. If you\u2019d prefer to make it by hand, you start by combining the ingredients, apart from the melted butter, in a bowl. Then beat in the butter using a balloon whisk, starting with just drips of butter at first, and adding the rest little by little. This is a Sunday roast with a difference.",

Add the pur\u00e9ed tomato mix, cook on a high heat for a few minutes, then turn the heat down low. Stir in the sugar, season generously and leave to simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for at least 15-20 minutes, and the longer, the better.

Cut the aubergines lengthways into roughly 5mm-thick slices; don\u2019t worry if they\u2019re not uniform, because the slices will be covered in the silky tomato sauce later. Brush both sides with extra-virgin olive oil and grill or griddle for five to six minutes a side, until well browned and extremely soft to the point of a knife \u2013 raw, pale aubergine is never a good thing!",

Spread a thin layer of sauce over the bottom of a medium-sized baking dish, and top first with a layer of the aubergine slices, followed by a layer of the spinach and ricotta mix. Grate a quarter of the mozzarella over the spinach layer, season lightly, then repeat with one or two more layers of each, depending on the size of your dish. Top with a final layer of tomato sauce. Scatter over the last of the mozzarella, parmesan and the reserved basil leaves, then drizzle with a little extra-virgin olive oil and bake for 30-35 minutes, until golden.

The method is this: instead of marinating the meat before cooking, you marinate it after; it really does keep it extraordinarily tender. Please feel free to play around with the herbs; I think Ed himself uses oregano rather than the thyme I love.\nI like this with broccoletti or those leggy tender-stem broccoli. A couple of packets, lightly cooked, drained, and sitting in the marinade after the beef's out and sliced, is the most heavenly accompaniment. And I can't tell you how good both steak and broccoli are cold later.",

            "Description": "This fantastically floral apricot chamomile cake recipe was created by the Guardian Feast writer, baker and food stylist Benjamina Ebuehi, who  made it to the quarter finals of The Great British Bake Off. The cake boasts a satisfying flavour combination that\u2019s delicate and sweet, and will leave you craving another slice - as all cakes should. An interesting use of the teabags (let\u2019s face it, most of us have a few of these in the back of the cupboard), makes for a very elegant flavour that\u2019s perfectly balanced with the sweet summer fruit. The addition of the almonds along with the apricots results in a pleasingly damp sponge, while the chopped pistachios add an extra crunch of texture.\n\n\nPhotograph: Lizzie Mayson/The Guardian.

Try to use Pink Lady apples as their juicy sweetness and floral aroma will raise this to another level. This will make a great starter or simple double the quantities for a delicious main course.

You can use it to fill cakes and pastries or decorate them, pour it over desserts, or roll it to make truffles. Here it\u2019s used to decorate your loaves. And, while there may be a lot of ingredients in the cake, it\u2019s actually a relatively simple dish. All the flavour comes from the different spices, plus the passion fruit curd, mango and coconut on top. This lip-smacking alternative to summer desserts like eton mess and trifle can be finished off with a scoop of ice cream if you\u2019re feeling really indulgent. \n\nPhotograph: Lizzie Mayson/The Guardian.

                "Preheat the oven to 190\u00b0C/170\u00b0C fan/gas 5. Grease the base and sides of 2 x 20cm round cake tins with vegan butter, then line the bases with baking paper.",
                "Add the soya milk, 55g of caster sugar, dark brown sugar, treacle, salt and oil to a large pan. Stir over a medium heat until the treacle has combined with the rest of the mixture. Take off the heat and stir in \u00bd tbsp of vanilla and the vinegar.",
                "In a bowl, combine all the dry cake ingredients, including the crystallised ginger. Tip into the pan of wet ingredients and whisk until just combined. Pour into the tins and bake for 25-30 mins, or until springy on top and a knife inserted into the middles comes out clean. Leave the cakes in their tins for 5 mins then run a knife around the edges and turn out onto a cooling rack. Peel off the baking paper and leave to cool completely.",
                "Meanwhile, make the caramel sauce. Add the remaining caster sugar and 40ml water to a saucepan set over a high heat. Stir occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved, then turn up the heat and wait until it turns an amber colour. Don\u2019t stir once the sugar has dissolved or it might turn grainy; instead, swirl the pan to even out the colour. Remove from the heat and add the coconut cream, stirring with a balloon whisk. The sauce will bubble up, so be careful! Continue stirring until you have a smooth, combined sauce. Add 15g of the vegan butter, stir until dissolved, then pour into a medium-sized bowl; sprinkle with a little salt, to taste. Cover and chill in the fridge for at least 2 hrs, or 1 hr in the freezer.",
                "Next, make the buttercreams. Add the remaining vegan butter and icing sugar to a large mixing bowl, then use an electric whisk to beat until pale and fluffy. Transfer two-thirds into a separate bowl and whisk in the vanilla. Add the Biscoff spread to the remaining third of the buttercream and whisk until well combined. The Biscoff can stiffen the buttercream, so add 1-2 tsp plant-based milk, as needed, to create a spreadable consistency.",
                "Once the cakes are cool, you can decorate them. If they rose into domes during baking, use a serrated knife to level the tops first. They\u2019ll keep for up to 5 days in an airtight container at room temperature, but are best within 1-2 days."

This is an easy to make, comforting pasta dish that\u2019s a perfect meat-free midweek meal.

If you want a spicier version, consider using mint, coriander or finely chopped lemongrass and choose your spices accordingly \u2013 chilli or pepper can be substituted for the mustard, say. Don\u2019t add anything that\u2019s too wet, though, or the casing will fall apart.",

Beat the two remaining raw eggs in a small bowl with a splash of water or milk. Put the flour on a small plate and season. Tip the breadcrumbs on to a third plate (ordinary ones will do, but panko are extra-crunchy).",
                "Put a square of clingfilm on a work surface and flour it lightly. Put one of the meatballs in the centre of the square and flour that lightly, too. Put another square of clingfilm on top, then roll out the meat until it\u2019s large enough to encase an egg, then remove the top piece of clingfilm.",

Bring up the sides of the bottom clingfilm square, so the meat surrounds the egg, then remove the plastic and use your hands to smooth the meat-wrapped egg into an egg shape.

(Once you\u2019ve got them to this stage, they will keep, covered, in the fridge for up to a couple of days, if need be.)",

Repeat the egg and breadcrumb layers. (Again, this is best done with hands rather than spoons; it\u2019s easier to wash off, too.) You can do this bit in advance, too, if you like \u2013 again, they\u2019ll keep in the fridge for a couple of days and still crisp up in the fryer.",

If you don\u2019t have a thermometer, a crumb of bread dropped in should sizzle and brown, but not burn, almost immediately. Carefully lower in two of the eggs with a heatproof slotted spoon.",

Carefully lift out, again with a slotted spoon, place on a cooling rack or a tray lined with kitchen paper to drain and, while they\u2019re still warm, sprinkle with a little salt. Bring the oil back to temperature, then repeat with the remaining two scotch eggs. If you\u2019re not eating them immediately, keep cool, but not refrigerated, otherwise the crisp coating may go soggy."

Test it on the back of the cake if you\u2019re not sure \u2013 wait a few mins to see how far the drip goes, then adjust the mixture with extra icing sugar (to thicken) or water (to loosen), as needed. When you\u2019re happy with the consistency, carefully spoon small amounts of icing around the edge of the cake, allowing it to drip down the side to different lengths.

Add a few drops of orange gel to a little more fondant and knead in until you have an even colour; use it to create the snowman\u2019s nose. To make the snowman\u2019s scarf and hat, colour more fondant in the same way using the red food gel. Pull off a small ball and flatten into a thick disc, then pop on the snowman\u2019s head as a hat; top with a white fondant bobble. Roll some more red fondant into a scarf shape and wrap it around the head; use a cocktail stick to add detail to the scarf and hat, if you like, such as indents at the ends of the scarf to resemble fringing, and a pattern to make the hat look knitted. Create the melting snowman\u2019s buttons using blobs of leftover blue buttercream, then stick 2 pretzel sticks into the cake for his arms."

Full of festive flavours that are equally tasty all year round, these easy-to-make cookies combine three types of sugar: light muscovado; demerara and icing sugar. The effect is a layer of flavour and a very pleasing extra crunch to the cookies. This is a family-friendly recipe, too, particularly as you can prep the dough ahead - it needs at least three hours to chill - and then have them all made in just half an hour. All you then have to do is pour a glass of milk and stick on your Christmas film of choice.\n\nPhotograph: Ola O Smit",

In this recipe from expert baker and food stylist Claire Ptak, there\u2019s one final cheat\u2019s twist: the marshmallow is simply browned under the grill, not baked in the oven, so there\u2019s no need to worry about melting the ice cream!",

Blanch the spinach for about 2 mins, until it\u2019s bright green, then drain and shock it in the iced water, to set the colour. Squeeze out the excess liquid from the spinach \u2013 you want it pretty dry, so it won\u2019t loosen the ricotta \u2013 then cut it up finely: you want it evenly chopped, to fold it through the ricotta with no large, uneven lumps. Put the spinach in a bowl with the ricotta, nutmeg, parmesan and lemon zest, then season, going a bit heavier with the pepper than usual.",
                "For the tomato sauce, put the olive oil in a heavy-based frying pan on a low heat. Add the garlic to the cold oil and let the oil slowly creep up to temperature: essentially, you want to flavour the oil here, so the garlic runs through the whole sauce. Once the garlic is gently frying, leave it to cook for a good 2 mins without taking on any colour: you want to cook all the flavour out of it without it taking on any of the bitterness it would get if it colours. Once it\u2019s ready, you should be able to pinch the garlic in between your fingers and meet no resistance. Add the tomatoes, smash them up with a wooden spoon, then turn up the heat and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to low and leave to simmer for about 1 hr, until all the liquid is cooked off, and the sauce has reduced and turned a deep red.",
                "While the tomatoes are cooking, stuff the cannelloni, which is easiest with a piping bag. Stick the nozzle of the bag about halfway into the pasta (I stand the tubes up on a plate), then squeeze and gently pull out the bag until the tube is filled. By the time you\u2019ve piped them all, the tomato sauce should be pretty much good to go.",
                "Preheat the oven to 190\u00b0C/170\u00b0C fan/gas 5. Use half the sauce to cover the base of a large baking tray, spreading it out nice and evenly. Lay the cannelloni in 2 or 3 straight rows on top (depending on the size of your dish), then pour over the rest of the sauce and tear in the whole bunch of basil. Pour 250ml boiling water into the tray \u2013 this is so the pasta can steam before it starts to colour. Lay the slices of mozzarella over the cannelloni, cover in lots of parmesan, and bake for 45 mins to 1 hr."

You should get the consistency of a boiled egg without having to take the shell off, and the cheese helps bind everything together. Add some spinach and avocado on the side for a healthy addition to your morning meal.",

They should not be sticky, tacky or wet when tested with your fingertip. This is an important part of macaroon making as it also helps them form a smooth, glossy surface and ensures that they have their trademark puffed out, crinkly base after they are baked.",

It\u2019s built from three sponge cakes sandwiched together with a vanilla buttercream filling. The spectacular rainbow is made from the same buttercream, but coloured with Dr Oetker\u2019s icing colours (don\u2019t forget a thin layer of \u2018crumb coat\u2019 icing to cover the sponge before you apply the rainbow as this prevents the cake from drying out and stops crumbs from getting in your outer layer of buttercream). The (extra) icing on the cake comes in the form of a chocolate ganache that drips down the sides. A true spectacle cake that will knock the socks off birthday guests (and probably passing strangers).  ",

Pop a sponge layer onto a cake board and spread a layer of buttercream on top, repeat with the other sponge layers to sandwich them together.

This will draw the water out of the onions and get the natural sugars caramelising much faster. You could always prepare the pie up to the baking stage and keep it in the fridge, then just put it in the oven when you want it nice and hot.",

            "Description": "The perfect huevos rancheros is mainly all about that tasty Mexican rancheros sauce, so why not make it the star of the show!\nOur recipe uses chorizo meat fried with onion, chilli and Gran Luchito Chipotle Paste. The simplicity of combining the delicious chorizo oil with the smokiness of the paste creates a beautiful base for the eggs. We then add cherry tomatoes, passata and a bit of chicken stock, all simmered down to concentrate the flavours.\n\nCook along with Gran Luchito\u2019s head chef Susy V here: https://gran.luchito.com/recipes/huevos-rancheros/",

Once it\u2019s hot enough, add the chorizo meat (without the casing) and break the meat into the pan with a wooden spoon. Let your chorizo crisp up slightly and once it\u2019s ready remove half of the chorizo from the pan and set aside.",
                "In the same pan with the remaining chorizo, add the onion, the red chilli and Chipotle Paste. Stir and cook for 5-6 minutes until the onion softens. You can then add the cherry tomatoes and stir briefly, season with a pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper.",

Drop the dumplings on top and return the casserole ot the oven, uncovered, to continue cooking for the remaining cooking time.",
                "Tips: to make in advance, up to 2 days ahead of time, cook the beef as above but for 1 1/2 hours only. Cool and keep in the fridge or freeze. Make the dumpling mixture and keep, covered in the fridge. When ready to use, thaw the beef if necessary, and bring to the boil on the hob, cover and place in the oven for 1 hour. Make and add the dumplings as above. The dumplings are optional but they are much lighter than traditional suet dumplings so don't make the dish stodgy. Alternatively, spread 6 thick slices of baguette with mustard and crushed garlic and pop them on top of the beef for the last 30 minutes."

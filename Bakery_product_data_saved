   'Product Information': 'Luxuriate in this heavenly match of chocolatey naughtiness and delicate, juicy cranberries… if you’d prefer a traditional pudding on Christmas Day, enjoy this one on Boxing Day or New Year! from your first spoonful, you won’t be able to stop eating it until the bowl is clean! smooth, very light, moist and not too sweet, this is a Christmas Pudding combination you will literally melt into! The Carved Angel began life in Dartmouth Devon as a restaurant in a glass fronted, three storey Tudor building where the open kitchen brought to the table the most exquisite and memorable food produced from fresh local ingredients.The highly talented Chef /Patron Joyce Molyneux named the restaurant after a wooden carving of an angel that was presented to her as a gift by a local carpenter before first opening. The statue sat proudly in the centre of the dining room until its doors closed in 2005. During the winter months, whilst the town was quiet, Joyce took advantage of the time of year to steam her Christmas Puddings made to a recipe created by the Victorian Chef Eliza Acton. Soon the success of these deliciously moist puddings spread far and wide and became the inspiration for a greater selection of gorgeous puddings and wonderful condiments created and mixed with the same high level of expertise and care using the best ingredients to ensure every mouthful is an absolute joy!\nCountry of Origin\nUnited Kingdom\nSuitable for the microwaveSuitable for vegetarians',

Lionel Poilâne called this search and combination of the best of old techniques with the best of new techniques, “Retro-Innovation.”Our bread is made of four ingredients: water, flour, salt and a natural rising agent (Sourdough about 80 years old).We source our sea salt from Guérande, in France.

Their wish is for you to enjoy their family heritage of continental-style baking when you take time to savour their authentic bakery products.Crafted in London with love by master bakersAgnes GabrielCo-founder,ManufacturerGradz Bakery,260 Abbeydale Road,Wembley,HA0 1TW.,Gradz Bakery,260 Abbeydale Road,Wembley,HA0 1TW.,Return To AddressGradz Bakery,260 Abbeydale Road,Wembley,HA0 1TW.hi@gradzbakery.co.uk0208 998 6077gradzbakery.co.uk,Gradz Bakery,260 Abbeydale Road,Wembley,HA0 1TW.hi@gradzbakery.co.uk0208 998 6077gradzbakery.co.uk",

Their wish is for you to enjoy their family heritage of continental-style baking when you take time to savour their authentic bakery products.Crafted in London with love by master bakersAgnes GabrielCo-founder,ManufacturerGradz Bakery,260 Abbeydale Road,Wembley,HA0 1TW.,Gradz Bakery,260 Abbeydale Road,Wembley,HA0 1TW.,Return To AddressGradz Bakery,260 Abbeydale Road,Wembley,HA0 1TW.hi@gradzbakery.co.uk0208 998 6077gradzbakery.co.uk,Gradz Bakery,260 Abbeydale Road,Wembley,HA0 1TW.hi@gradzbakery.co.uk0208 998 6077gradzbakery.co.uk",

   'Product Information': 'Naturally leavened product, with the typical high shape of\npanettone, and surface with a typical crosscut. The yellow dough is enriched with sultana raisin and orange peel from Sicily. Crafted to be enjoyed every day, a simple way to sweeten your time at home. The high-quality ingredients are guaranteed by us at Loison and the subtle graphic design on the top of the box reflects the flavor variety of the product contained inside.\n\n\nA fire warms the heart and makes the dough rise.  Our oven has been burning for three generations, keeping old baking traditions alive.  There is a present, a past and a future that smells of vanilla and candied fruit.  Our artisanal products become gifts that seduce the palate and capture the eyes.  Our craft tells the story of our region, as it speaks to the world.  This is Loison.\n\n\nIf you are after quality, then you have to be continuously there during all the production processes.  From the purchase of the finest ingredients, to the creation and manual packaging of the finished product, we follow the highest standards of certification.  Over time, this strategic process has resulted in a quality product that makes us stand out in the world.\n\n\nOur starter dough is the result of the spontaneous fermentation of wheat flour, water, milk and fruit that were blended and set aside.  This is where we get the slightly sour-smelling and tasting natural yeast that we use daily in our various products.  The sourdough contains a high number of microorganisms, which multiply and stimulate optimal leavening.  After 72 hours of patient work, the end product is naturally free of any pathogenic germs, so there is no need for preservatives.  The sourdough contains about 100 billion saccharomyces and 2000 billion lactobacilli.  These help reduce the sugar content in the dough as it is being kneaded by hand and while it bakes.  The result is a soft spongy product that is highly digestible.\n\n\nOur ingredients are selected with care through diligent research.  We pot for controlled designation or origin labels, preferably Italian, especially in the case of fresh ingredients.  That is why we choose eggs from safe farms, milk and butter produced in the mountains, top-grade and natural Italian sugar.  We want to ensure we are crafting a truly exclusive Italian product.\n\nCountry of Origin\nITALY\nSuitable for the microwave',

   'Product Information': 'This traditional luxury Christmas pudding is neither too dark nor too pale, moist yet light, with a flavour of subtle spice, sweetness and warmth created from the brandy that combines with the soft textured fruit to provide the perfect, sumptuous tasting festive pudding.The Carved Angel began life in Dartmouth Devon as a restaurant in a glass fronted, three storey Tudor building where the open kitchen brought to the table the most exquisite and memorable food produced from fresh local ingredients.The highly talented Chef /Patron Joyce Molyneux named the restaurant after a wooden carving of an angel that was presented to her as a gift by a local carpenter before first opening. The statue sat proudly in the centre of the dining room until its doors closed in 2005. During the winter months, whilst the town was quiet, Joyce took advantage of the time of year to steam her Christmas Puddings made to a recipe created by the Victorian Chef Eliza Acton. Soon the success of these deliciously moist puddings spread far and wide and became the inspiration for a greater selection of gorgeous puddings and wonderful condiments created and mixed with the same high level of expertise and care using the best ingredients to ensure every mouthful is an absolute joy!\nCountry of Origin\nUnited Kingdom\nSuitable for the microwaveSuitable for vegetarians',

   'Product Information': 'The Pandoro is a naturally leavened product, traditionally shaped like a frustum with an eight-pointed star section. The yellow dough is enriched with butter and Vanilla Mananara from Madagascar. The cake is served with vanilla-scented icing sugar.\n\nA fire warms the heart and makes the dough rise.  Our oven has been burning for three generations, keeping old baking traditions alive.  There is a present, a past and a future that smells of vanilla and candied fruit.  Our artisanal products become gifts that seduce the palate and capture the eyes.  Our craft tells the story of our region, as it speaks to the world.  This is Loison.\n\nIf you are after quality, then you have to be continuously there during all the production processes.  From the purchase of the finest ingredients, to the creation and manual packaging of the finished product, we follow the highest standards of certification.  Over time, this strategic process has resulted in a quality product that makes us stand out in the world.\n\nOur starter dough is the result of the spontaneous fermentation of wheat flour, water, milk and fruit that were blended and set aside.  This is where we get the slightly sour-smelling and tasting natural yeast that we use daily in our various products.  The sourdough contains a high number of microorganisms, which multiply and stimulate optimal leavening.  After 72 hours of patient work, the end product is naturally free of any pathogenic germs, so there is no need for preservatives.  The sourdough contains about 100 billion saccharomyces and 2000 billion lactobacilli.  These help reduce the sugar content in the dough as it is being kneaded by hand and while it bakes.  The result is a soft spongy product that is highly digestible.\n\nOur ingredients are selected with care through diligent research.  We pot for controlled designation or origin labels, preferably Italian, especially in the case of fresh ingredients.  That is why we choose eggs from safe farms, milk and butter produced in the mountains, top-grade and natural Italian sugar.  We want to ensure we are crafting a truly exclusive Italian product.\nCountry of Origin\nITALY',

  '482551011': {'Name': 'Loison Mandarin Panettone 1000g',
   'Product Information': 'The Panettone is a naturally leavened product, which features a low shape and is made according to an ancient Milanese recipe. This fragrant cake has a top cross-cut by hand, a soft texture and is enriched with Sultana Raisin, Ciaculli late Mandarin and natural Mananara vanilla from Madagascar.\n\nA fire warms the heart and makes the dough rise.  Our oven has been burning for three generations, keeping old baking traditions alive.  There is a present, a past and a future that smells of vanilla and candied fruit.  Our artisanal products become gifts that seduce the palate and capture the eyes.  Our craft tells the story of our region, as it speaks to the world.  This is Loison.\n\nIf you are after quality, then you have to be continuously there during all the production processes.  From the purchase of the finest ingredients, to the creation and manual packaging of the finished product, we follow the highest standards of certification.  Over time, this strategic process has resulted in a quality product that makes us stand out in the world.\n\nOur starter dough is the result of the spontaneous fermentation of wheat flour, water, milk and fruit that were blended and set aside.  This is where we get the slightly sour-smelling and tasting natural yeast that we use daily in our various products.  The sourdough contains a high number of microorganisms, which multiply and stimulate optimal leavening.  After 72 hours of patient work, the end product is naturally free of any pathogenic germs, so there is no need for preservatives.  The sourdough contains about 100 billion saccharomyces and 2000 billion lactobacilli.  These help reduce the sugar content in the dough as it is being kneaded by hand and while it bakes.  The result is a soft spongy product that is highly digestible.\n\nOur ingredients are selected with care through diligent research.  We pot for controlled designation or origin labels, preferably Italian, especially in the case of fresh ingredients.  That is why we choose eggs from safe farms, milk and butter produced in the mountains, top-grade and natural Italian sugar.  We want to ensure we are crafting a truly exclusive Italian product.\nCountry of Origin\nITALY',

   'Product Information': 'This traditional luxury Christmas pudding is neither too dark nor too pale, moist yet light, with a flavour of subtle spice, sweetness and warmth created from the brandy that combines with the soft textured fruit to provide the perfect, sumptuous tasting festive pudding.The Carved Angel began life in Dartmouth Devon as a restaurant in a glass fronted, three storey Tudor building where the open kitchen brought to the table the most exquisite and memorable food produced from fresh local ingredients.The highly talented Chef /Patron Joyce Molyneux named the restaurant after a wooden carving of an angel that was presented to her as a gift by a local carpenter before first opening. The statue sat proudly in the centre of the dining room until its doors closed in 2005. During the winter months, whilst the town was quiet, Joyce took advantage of the time of year to steam her Christmas Puddings made to a recipe created by the Victorian Chef Eliza Acton. Soon the success of these deliciously moist puddings spread far and wide and became the inspiration for a greater selection of gorgeous puddings and wonderful condiments created and mixed with the same high level of expertise and care using the best ingredients to ensure every mouthful is an absolute joy!\nCountry of Origin\nUnited Kingdom\nSuitable for the microwaveSuitable for vegetarians',

   'Product Information': 'Fair Verona’s golden cake is a rich, icing sugar covered, Christmas mini-masterpiece. Rip it up and get stuck in with an espresso, a spoonful of gelato or something delicious and sticky. Buon Natale!\n\n\nPandoro originates from Verona where the original recipe dates back to the late 1800s, with its classical octagonal shape being introduced in the last century. Harvey Nichols Mini Pandoro is made exclusively for us by Amaretti Virginia, the iconic brand that has been synonymous with Italy’s finest desserts and pastries since 1860. This is a piccolo version of the popular classic, known rather endearingly as a Pandorino. However, no pandas were harmed in its making, rather it’s a careful blending of butter, eggs and sugar, followed by a complex and lengthy leavening process using natural yeast.\nCountry of Origin\nItaly\nOrganicSuitable for vegetarians\nLIFE 1m+\nProduct life guaranteed for 1 month.',

The yellow dough is enriched with dark chocolate drops and chocolate cream.  Crafted to be enjoyed every day, the products of this line offer a simple way to sweeten your time at home. The high-quality ingredients are guaranteed by us at Loison and the subtle graphic design on the top of the box reflects the flavor variety of the product contained inside.\n\n\nA fire warms the heart and makes the dough rise.  Our oven has been burning for three generations, keeping old baking traditions alive.  There is a present, a past and a future that smells of vanilla and candied fruit.  Our artisanal products become gifts that seduce the palate and capture the eyes.  Our craft tells the story of our region, as it speaks to the world.  This is Loison.\n\n\nIf you are after quality, then you have to be continuously there during all the production processes.  From the purchase of the finest ingredients, to the creation and manual packaging of the finished product, we follow the highest standards of certification.  Over time, this strategic process has resulted in a quality product that makes us stand out in the world.\n\n\nOur starter dough is the result of the spontaneous fermentation of wheat flour, water, milk and fruit that were blended and set aside.  This is where we get the slightly sour-smelling and tasting natural yeast that we use daily in our various products.  The sourdough contains a high number of microorganisms, which multiply and stimulate optimal leavening.  After 72 hours of patient work, the end product is naturally free of any pathogenic germs, so there is no need for preservatives.  The sourdough contains about 100 billion saccharomyces and 2000 billion lactobacilli.  These help reduce the sugar content in the dough as it is being kneaded by hand and while it bakes.  The result is a soft spongy product that is highly digestible.\n\n\nOur ingredients are selected with care through diligent research.  We pot for controlled designation or origin labels, preferably Italian, especially in the case of fresh ingredients.  That is why we choose eggs from safe farms, milk and butter produced in the mountains, top-grade and natural Italian sugar.  We want to ensure we are crafting a truly exclusive Italian product.\n\nCountry of Origin\n\nITALY',

   'Product Information': 'The Pandoro is a naturally leavened product, traditionally shaped like a frustum with an eight-pointed star section. The yellow dough is enriched with butter,  Vanilla Mananara from Madagascar and salted caramel. The cake is served with vanilla-scented icing sugar.\n\n\nA fire warms the heart and makes the dough rise.  Our oven has been burning for three generations, keeping old baking traditions alive.  There is a present, a past and a future that smells of vanilla and candied fruit.  Our artisanal products become gifts that seduce the palate and capture the eyes.  Our craft tells the story of our region, as it speaks to the world.  This is Loison.\n\n\nIf you are after quality, then you have to be continuously there during all the production processes.  From the purchase of the finest ingredients, to the creation and manual packaging of the finished product, we follow the highest standards of certification.  Over time, this strategic process has resulted in a quality product that makes us stand out in the world.\n\n\nOur starter dough is the result of the spontaneous fermentation of wheat flour, water, milk and fruit that were blended and set aside.  This is where we get the slightly sour-smelling and tasting natural yeast that we use daily in our various products.  The sourdough contains a high number of microorganisms, which multiply and stimulate optimal leavening.  After 72 hours of patient work, the end product is naturally free of any pathogenic germs, so there is no need for preservatives.  The sourdough contains about 100 billion saccharomyces and 2000 billion lactobacilli.  These help reduce the sugar content in the dough as it is being kneaded by hand and while it bakes.  The result is a soft spongy product that is highly digestible.\n\n\nOur ingredients are selected with care through diligent research.  We pot for controlled designation or origin labels, preferably Italian, especially in the case of fresh ingredients.  That is why we choose eggs from safe farms, milk and butter produced in the mountains, top-grade and natural Italian sugar.  We want to ensure we are crafting a truly exclusive Italian product.\n\n\n\nCountry of Origin\n\nITALY',
